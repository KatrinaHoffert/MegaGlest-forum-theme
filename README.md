# MegaGlest forum theme
This is the Simple Machines Forum theme used by the [MegaGlest forum](https://forum.megaglest.org/). It's
a derivative of the default theme (BSD licensed).

This is an uploading of a repo that didn't initially use version control, so there's no history.

## Installation
The entire repo is the theme. Just zip it up and upload it to your SMF installation as a theme to install. Should
work for all SMF 2.x.
